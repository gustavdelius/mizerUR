#' mizerUR: Unstructured Resource Components for mizer
#'
#' This is an extension package for the mizer package
#' https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/. Mizer has a size-structured planktonic
#' resource. With this extension you can also model any number of unstructured
#' resource components. Such unstructured components are appropriate whenever
#' the predation on these components is not size based.
#'
#' Possible applications include the modelling of detritus as a resource for
#' detritivores, carrion as a resource for scavengers, or macroflora on which
#' fish can graze.
